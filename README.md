# han-san-dispenser
This project is an arduino based project that tracks hand sanitizer use when using an automatic hand sanitizer dispenser. It uses an Ultrasonic range finder to determine how many people are entering a space and an IR break beam sensor to determine how many people sanitize. All PHP code is for a personal website that has live data updates on various graphs.
